# bikeshare-dataset-investigation Overview
In this project, I will use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

I will answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
