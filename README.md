# Bike-Share System Dataset Investigation
> [<i><b>Link to my script</b></i>](https://github.com/HaCkeMati314n/bikeshare-dataset-investigation/blob/main/bikeshare.py)<br>
## <i>Overview</i>
<i>In this project, I will use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
I will answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.</i>
